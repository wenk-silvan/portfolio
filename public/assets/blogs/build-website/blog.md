## Introduction
Let’s get real for a second: building websites used to sound like rocket science, right? Like, you needed some kind of secret degree in "I-Can-Write-Magic-Code" to put a couple of pages online. But, in today's world, it's so much easier than ever before!

I’m here to walk you through building a modern website using Angular, TailwindCSS, ExpressJS, and Firebase Hosting. Sounds fancy? Sure. Difficult? Nah. You’ll be a website wizard by the end of this guide, without needing to grow a beard like Gandalf.

Let’s break it down step by step, and I promise I’ll try to keep it fun. You might even chuckle along the way. 😊

## Step 1: Setting the Stage: Installing Angular
So, you want to build a website, huh? First, we’re going to use Angular—a powerful front-end framework by Google. Think of Angular as your website’s brain, making everything work like a well-oiled machine. If you’re new to Angular, don’t worry. We’ll take baby steps. Or, at least, toddler steps. 😉

First, you need to install Node.js if you don’t already have it. Head over to nodejs.org and download the latest stable version. Once it’s installed, go ahead and install the Angular CLI (Command Line Interface).

Open your terminal (the thing that looks like it’s from the '90s and people type code into) and run this magic command:

`npm install -g @angular/cli`

Once that’s done, let’s create a new Angular project:

`ng new my-awesome-website`

Angular will ask you a few questions, just like a casual first date. Go with the default settings and say “yes” when it asks if you want routing (trust me, you’ll want it). Once you’re done, CD into your new project folder:

`cd my-awesome-website`

Now run:

`ng serve`

And, bam! You have a basic website running on localhost:4200. It might not look like much right now, but hey, that’s what we're here for. Let’s move on to making it look gorgeous.

## Step 2: TailwindCSS: Style Without Stress
Now, I know what you’re thinking: “Ugh, CSS. The painful part.” But worry not, my friend, because we’re going to use TailwindCSS. Tailwind is like a magical CSS toolbox that makes your website look pretty without giving you a migraine.

Let’s get TailwindCSS set up in our Angular project. First, install Tailwind by running this:

`npm install -D tailwindcss`

Now generate the configuration files:

`npx tailwindcss init`

You'll see a tailwind.config.js file pop up in your project. Open that up and add the following under the content section:

```
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{html,ts}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Next, head over to your src/styles.css file and import Tailwind:

```
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Boom! TailwindCSS is now ready to sprinkle your project with beauty like it's fairy dust. Want to make a button look amazing without writing 100 lines of CSS? Easy. In your app.component.html, try something like this:

```
<button class="bg-blue-500 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded hover:bg-blue-700">
  Click Me!
</button>
```

See that? No fuss, no complicated styles, just clean, beautiful components. You’ll be styling like a pro in no time.

## Step 3: ExpressJS – Your Backend Buddy
Now, we can’t forget about the backend. The backend is the invisible hero of the web. It’s the guy behind the curtain pulling all the strings. For this, we’ll use ExpressJS, a minimal and flexible Node.js web framework that makes it easy to handle server-side operations.

First, create a folder for your backend (you can call it backend or server, depending on your mood). Then, run:

```
npm init -y
npm install express
```

Create a file called server.js and paste the following code:

```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Serve static files from the Angular app
app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/dist/my-awesome-website'));

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(__dirname + '/dist/my-awesome-website/index.html');
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

This is a simple server that’ll serve your Angular files once the project is built. Once your Angular app is ready for deployment, you’ll build it, and Express will handle delivering the static files to the user.

You can test it out locally by building the Angular app:


`ng build --prod`

And then run your Express server:

`node server.js`

Now, your backend is working, and you’re ready for action. Well done, you! 🎉

## Step 4: Firebase Hosting – Deploy Like a Boss
Now comes the part where you show the world your masterpiece. We’re going to use Firebase Hosting, which is like Airbnb for your websites. You don’t have to worry about renting servers or setting up complex configurations. Firebase handles all the hard stuff for you.

First, install the Firebase CLI:

`npm install -g firebase-tools`

Login to Firebase:

`firebase login`

Now, initialize Firebase in your project:


`firebase init`

Firebase will ask you what you want to use. Select Hosting. Then, it’ll ask which directory you want to use as your public directory. Type dist/my-awesome-website. Firebase will also ask if you want it to configure as a single-page app (SPA). Say “yes.” You can say “no” to the other options for now.

Next, build your Angular app one more time:

`ng build --prod`

And then, to deploy it, run:

`firebase deploy`

Ta-da! 🎉 Your website is live and running on the internet! Give yourself a high-five. You’ve just deployed your Angular app, styled with Tailwind, backed by ExpressJS, and hosted on Firebase.

## Step 5: Optional – Drink Coffee, Admire Your Work
You’ve built a website from scratch using Angular, TailwindCSS, ExpressJS, and Firebase. At this point, feel free to sit back, sip your coffee (or tea, or juice, or whatever keeps you going), and marvel at how much of a website wizard you’ve become. 🧙‍♂️

If someone asks, just say, “Oh, it’s no big deal. Just a little something I threw together.” You’ll look both humble and cool.

## Conclusion
So, there you have it. Creating a modern website isn’t as terrifying as it sounds when you break it down step by step. With Angular handling your front-end, TailwindCSS giving you style without the stress, ExpressJS keeping your backend tidy, and Firebase serving as your digital landlord, you’re set up for success.

Now, go forth and build something awesome! And remember, coding isn’t about being perfect; it’s about having fun, breaking things, fixing them, and enjoying the journey. 👩‍💻👨‍💻

Cheers to your new website-building superpowers! 🥳
